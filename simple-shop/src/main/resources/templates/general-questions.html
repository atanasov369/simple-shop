    <p><strong>1) </strong><strong>I would like to return a gift that was sent to me. How do I do that?</strong></p>

    <p>Eshop is very sorry that your gift did not work for you. Please call the Eshop Customer Loyalty Team
        for assistance returning the item.</p>

    <p><strong>2) </strong><strong>How long does it take for me to get a refund?</strong></p>

    <p>For the vast majority of returns, it takes about 5-10 Business Days for us to get your package at the
        fulfillment center, inspect your return, process it into inventory, and complete your refund. If the
        refund
        is being issued to a credit card, depending on your credit card company, it may take an additional 2-10
        Business Days after your credit is applied for it to post to your account.</p>

    <p><strong>3) </strong><strong>Do you do back orders?</strong></p>

    <p>No. We do not do back orders. If an item is out of stock the Eshop Customer Loyalty Team will notify you
        as
        soon as possible and ask if you would like a replacement item. Out of stock orders will be cancelled
        unless
        a replacement item is requested.</p>

    <p><strong>4) </strong><strong>Is the item I want going to go on sale soon?</strong></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Eshop does not know if an item will go on sale or be marked down until it actually
        happens. </p>

    <p><strong>5) </strong><strong>How can I get assistance if I need it?</strong></p>
